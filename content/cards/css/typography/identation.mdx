There are two ways to indent a paragraph text in CSS:
- using `text-indent` property;
- or by styling the first line of a paragraph with `::first-line` pseudo-element, providing a padding or margin;
- or by styling the first letter of a paragraph with `::first-letter` pseudo-element, providing a padding or margin.

```css
  .text-indent {
    text-indent: 2rem;
  }

  .line-indent::first-line {
    padding-left: 2rem;
  }

  .letter-indent::first-letter {
    padding-left: 2rem;
  }
```
