Hyphenation in CSS can be achieved using the [`hyphens` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens). The `hyphens` property controls when and where words should be hyphenated. It can take three values: `none`, `manual` (through manual usage of `&shy;` html symbol), and `auto`.

```css
p {
  hyphens: auto;
  overflow-wrap: break-word; /* Breaks words not detected by a hyphenation algorithm */
}
```
