Multi-column layout is one of the main layout modes along with flow, positioned, flexbox and grid layouts. Spawned with a `columns: <count>` property. Gaps between columns are controlled with a `column-gap` property and these can be filled with borders using a `column-rule` property (same syntax as for `border` one).

One of the major problems which may arise is splitting of a paragraph between different columns. To fix that, use a `break-inside: avoid` property on column children.

Additionally, an element spanning across all columns may be inserted with a `column-span: all` property. Remaining elements will position themselves above and below the span.

Complete example:

```css
div {
    columns: 3;
    column-gap: 2rem;
    column-rule: 1px dotted darkslategray;
}

p {
    break-inside: avoid; /* auto (default, makes breaks) | avoid | avoid-region | avoid-column | avoid-page */
}

blockquote {
    column-span: all; /* none (= a single column) | all */
}
```
