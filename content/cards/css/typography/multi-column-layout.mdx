One of the main layout modes, along with flow, positioned, flexbox and grid layouts. Set `column-gap` to add gaps, and `column-rule` to add borders between columns.
```css
div {
    columns: 3;
    column-gap: 2rem;
    column-rule: 1px dotted darkslategray;
}
```
Use `break-inside: avoid` to prevent splitting paragraphs between columns. Use `column-span: all` to make an element span all columns.

```css
p {
    break-inside: avoid; /* auto (default, makes breaks) | avoid | avoid-region | avoid-column | avoid-page */
}

blockquote {
    column-span: all; /* none (= a single column) | all */
}
```
