By default, all fonts have kerning enabled, except for `monospace` ones. Kerning may also be disabled automatically for smaller font-sizes. Disabling kerning can be achieved through `font-kerning` property set to `none`:
```css
p {
  font-kerning: none; /* auto | normal */
}
```

Kerning can be increased or decreased by using `letter-spacing` property. The value is a spacing *added* to an existing auto-calculated spacing between letters.
```css
p {
  letter-spacing: 0.05rem; /* any length values */
}
```

To kern individual letters, disable kerning, then wrap each letter in a separate `<span>` and set letter-spacing there individually:

```css
p {
  font-kerning: none; /* any length values */
}

p > span:nth-of-type(1) {
  letter-spacing: 0.1rem;
}

p > span:nth-of-type(2) {
  letter-spacing: 0.08rem;
}

p > span:nth-of-type(3) {
  letter-spacing: 0.105rem;
}

/* ...so on... */
```
