1. Target the first letter of the first paragraph with a `:first-of-type::first-letter` selector.
2. Apply a larger font size.
3. Set the `line-height` to the same value as the font size to avoid excessive vertical space around the letter.
4. Add `float: left` to move the letter to the left and make the text wrap around it.
5. Use `margin-right` to create space between the drop cap and the rest of the text.

```css
p:first-of-type::first-letter {
  font-size: 3rem;
  line-height: 1em;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 0.2em;
}
```
