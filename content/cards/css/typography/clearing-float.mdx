  When multiple floated elements exist, they may collide with each other, causing a 'staircase' layout. How to make an element flow below a previous one?

A `clear` property allows elements that are located later in html to float below previous elements. The available values are `left | right | both | none`.

The property can also be applied to non-floating elements. In this case, their border-edge is moved below any floats on that side.
