  When multiple float elements exist, they may collide with each other, which results in a 'staircase' layout. How to make an element float below a previous one?

```css
.clear {
  clear: left; /* right | both | none */
}
```
A `clear` property allows elements that are located later in html to float below previous elements.

The property can also be applied to non-floating elements. Their border-edge is then moved down below any floats on that side.
