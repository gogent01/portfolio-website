The three strategies are `none`, `antialiased` and `subpixel-antialiased`, set through a `-webkit-font-smoothing` property:

```css
p {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; /* none | antialiased | subpixel-antialiased (default) */
}
```

Subpixel antialiasing works only on macOS, though, excluding Firefox. Windows uses `antialiased` value by default, and it is not subject to changes.

> Subpixel antialiasing is a technique of font smoothing which uses only red / green / blue parts of pixels around letters. It produces thicker font lines, but is of little use in a modern era of high-DPI screens.
