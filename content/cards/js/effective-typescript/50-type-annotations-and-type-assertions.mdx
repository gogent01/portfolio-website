*Type annotation* goes after declaring a variable, but before assignment of a value to it. *Type assertion* goes after the value using `as` keyword.

```typescript
type Car = {
  brand: string;
  maxSpeedMPH: number;
}

// type annotation
const ambulance: Car = {
  brand: 'Mercedes',
  maxSpeedMPH: 90,
}

// type assertion
const policeCar = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  maxSpeedMPH: 135,
} as Car;
```

Prefer type annotations everywhere, as they perform value checks for conforming the type.

Type assertions, on the contrary, do not check anything. Use them when you definitely know more about a variable than a compiler. A good style is to also include a comment next to each type assertion on why it is valid.

> Type assertions are incorrectly to be named as 'type casts.' The runtime value type does not change during an assertion. Any type information gets removed upon compilation.
