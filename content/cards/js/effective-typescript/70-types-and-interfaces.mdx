Types and interfaces in TS are very alike each other. Both:
- can be used to define a named type
- support index signature
- can define function types
- support generics
- can extend each other (through `extends` for interfaces and `&` for types)
- can be `implement`ed by a class
- can be recursive

Only types:
- support unions (`'A' | 'a'`)
- and extension of unions (`(A | B) & C`)
- have cleaner syntax for function types (`(a: number) => number`) and tuple types (`[a: string, b: string]`)

Only interfaces:
- complain if a subtype overrides some parent property type (type intersection produces `never` silently, which makes the property unusable)
- can be *augmented* (i.e., support *declaration merging*) (they combine all fields from multiple interface definitions inside one file; useful for library declaration files)
