  What is an excess property checking and how does it differ from a regular type checking?

During *excess property checking* TS checks whether *an object literal* of a certain type has all properties following the type definition and *no more*.

```typescript
type Car = {
  brand: string;
  maxSpeedMPH: number;
}

const ambulance: Car = {
  brand: 'Mercedes',
  maxSpeedMPH: 90,
  capacity: 6, // ~~~~ 'capacity' does not exist in type 'Car'...
}
```

But no error is thrown when a non-literal object is assigned due to the *regular type checking*:

```typescript
type Car = {
  brand: string;
  maxSpeedMPH: number;
}

const someCar = {
  brand: 'Mercedes',
  maxSpeedMPH: 90,
  capacity: 6,
}

const ambulance: Car = someCar;
```

But for *weak types* (objects with only optional properties) assignability checks require that object is either is empty or at least has one property same as in type definition:

```typescript
type Option = {
    label?: string;
    value?: string;
};

const o1 = {};
const o2 = {
    label: 'Second option',
};
const o3 = {
    label: 'Third option',
    key: 'third-option',
}
const o4 = {
    key: 'third-option',
}

let option: Option = o1; // ✅
option = o2; // ✅
option = o3; // ✅
option = o4; // ❌
```
