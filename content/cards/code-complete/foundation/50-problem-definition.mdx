A project must start with a **problem definition**. It should be stated in user language (without technical terms) and as a *problem* (not a possible solution). Wrong problems lead to wrong requirements -> architecture -> code -> product. Keep in mind also, that sometimes a code or a program is not a solution to a problem at all!

### Examples of good problem definitions:
- We can't keep up with orders from ABC.
- Our users cannot understand what to do on a product selection screen.
- We spend too much time collecting contact data of decision-makers in LinkedIn.
- Patients forget to take their daily pills on average twice a week.

### Examples of bad problem definitions:
- We need to optimize our data-entry system to keep up with orders from ABC.
- We need to hire a designer to rework the UI of a product-selection screen.
- We need to build a parser of LinkedIn data.
- We need to create a mobile application reminding our patients to take pills daily.
