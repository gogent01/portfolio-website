It is completely normal for requirements to be changed in the development process. It is alright for clients to understand they need more capabilities. The problem is to keep up with changes and do not overuse the initially planned budget.

### Measures to handle change requests:
- Ensure everyone knows the cost of requirements changes. Key phrase: `"Gee, that sounds like a great idea. Since it's not in the requirements document, I'll work up a revised schedule and cost estimate so that you can decide whether you want to do it now or later."`
- Check new requirements vs. a business need for the project. Are the requested changes relevant to the problem and its solution?
- Use an iterative approach. Evolutionary prototyping allows coding a small portion of required features, get feedback from users, specify additional requirements and proceed to one more small iteration.
- Set up a change-control procedure. Some process to accept change requests, review them and output changes to costs and development plan. Dev team is happy, because all change requests are carefully reviewed. A client is happy, because they know that changes are going to be handled properly.
- Finally, dump the project. If nothing works for some reason, better to stop the development, rather than getting deeper and deeper into change request overflow.
