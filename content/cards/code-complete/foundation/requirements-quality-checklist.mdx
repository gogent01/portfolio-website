- Are the requirements written in the **user's language**? Do the users think so?
- Are requirements **clear enough** to be handed over to an independent dev team and still be understood? Do the developers think so?
- Does each requirement avoid conflicts with other requirements?
- Are acceptable trade-offs between competing attributes (e.g., robustness vs. correctness) specified?
- Do the requirements avoid specifying the design?
- Is the level of detail consistent throughout the requirements? Should any of them be specified in more detail? Should any of them be specified in less detail?
- Is each requirement item **relevant** to the problem and its solution? Can each item be traced to its origin in the problem environment?
- Is each requirement **testable**? Will it be possible for an independent testing team to determine whether each requirement has been satisfied?
- Are all **possible changes** to the requirements specified, including descriptions and likelihoods of each change?
