- Where information is not available before development begins, are the *areas of incompleteness* specified?
- Are the requirements complete in the sense that if the product satisfies every requirement, it will be acceptable?
- Am I (or the team) *comfortable* with all the requirements? Have I eliminated requirements that are impossible to implement, but which are included just to please the customer?
