Metaphor is an analogy. Trying on a metaphor allows one to get more into a poorly understood topic using another topic which is better understood. Being able to apply a suitable metaphor is a sign of good topic understanding. Metaphors simplify communication by abstracting concepts and reducing the need for detailed explanations.

> A good metaphor is simple, relates well to other relevant metaphors and explains *much* of experimental evidence and other observed phenomena.

A suitable metaphor focuses attention on important parts of a phenomenon. An unsuitable one draws attention away and prohibits new discoveries. E.g., Copernian heliocentric theory led to the discovery of new planets, which were impossible to find using an old earth-centric view.

Although with the science development, one metaphor changes another, older metaphors do not usually become obsolete. Rather, they can be used whenever a simpler approach is enough. E.g., Newtonian physics is used in modeling real-world macro objects, although theoretically Einsteinian relativity theorem is much more precise.
