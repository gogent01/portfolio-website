## (Letter) Writing

Pros: this metaphor reflects well a process of a single-person work on a small project. One just sits down and writes stuff, figuring out construction details on the go.

Cons: while letter-writing is a single-person job, software development includes work of multiple people. A finished letter cannot be changed, but software can, and easily. Writing concentrates on using original texts, but software development promotes use of common patterns.


## Farming Crops

Pros: indeed, software development usually and preferably is done in small iterative additions to the codebase, in the same manner as crop growth happens.

Cons: crops grow by themselves in specific timelines, but code is created with peoples' will and managers' decisions. Also, any actions around crop growth (fertilization, harvesting, etc.) are hard to apply to software development activities.


## Oyster Pearl Accretion

Pros: as an oyster builds a pearl layer by layer, engineers develop their code themselves by gradual additions.

Cons: once formed, pearl layers cannot be changed, but it is not the case for software products.


## Construction of a Building

Pros: same idea of accretion, but now with a lot of useful additions. Construction is carried out incrementally by multiple people (of multiple specializations), planning and architecting phases come before an actual building process. All parts of a building can be changed, but the later a need for a change arises, the costlier the change is going to be in terms of both time and money. Also, construction promotes use of already built things, such as plumbing, doors and windows, and home electronics; although for really custom and expensive projects some of these may be crafted from scratch. Also, as buildings are planned with some safety margins (the bigger and important a building is, the greater), the same applies to software development planning.

Cons: hard to find, the metaphor is strong.
