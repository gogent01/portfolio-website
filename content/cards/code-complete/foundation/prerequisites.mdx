Prerequisite work is gathering of requirements and 'global' stuff: what kind of product is going to be built, for which platforms and uses, how many people are going to work on it, what are their qualifications, how much time does the team have, what are legal requirements, and so on.

Researches at HP, IBM, etc. found it is 10 to 100 times more expensive to fix an error in a post-release stage than during a prerequisite and requirement collection stage. Generally, in a stage chain of `requirements - architecture - construction - post-release` next stage cost amplifier is around 3. If something costs \$500 to fix at a requirement stage, it will cost \$13,500 at a construction stage, no matter whether the project is sequential or iterative.
