Having written requirements is crucial for a project success:
- a user starts to drive system functionality by agreeing on stated requirements
- programmers better understand their tasks without fallbacks to guesswork
- arguments can be resolved by referring to a requirement document
- detailed requirements allow covering much more of edge cases for a construction step, decreasing the number of post-coding changes (remember about 10-100x cost increase when fixing errors on post-release stage rather than on architecture stage)
