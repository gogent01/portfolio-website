- major (and all the most critical) classes and their responsibilities
- relationships between classes (class hierarchies and subsystems)
- communication between classes
- alternatives considered for each class and reasons for the final choice

Following 20/80 rule is enough: list 20% of classes responsible for 80% of the system's functionality. The rest can be specified at construction time.
