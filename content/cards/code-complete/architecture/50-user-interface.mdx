- UI design should be specified during requirements or architecture phase (major page formats, GUIs, CLIs, etc.)
- UI architecture should be modular and independent of business logic, so interface elements could be easily swapped (e.g., GUI to CLI and back)
- if i18n is considered, its implementation should be described (in-code, in-class, in-file) with a rationale for the final choice
