- the architecture must define the major *building blocks* of a program (classes or their subsystems)
- every feature in requirements must be covered with at least one building block
- each block should have a single area of responsibility and know as little as possible about other blocks
- communication between blocks should be well-defined, the architecture should specify how blocks use each other in direct or indirect way
- if the architecture depends on some business rules, it must specify them and describe their impact on the design
