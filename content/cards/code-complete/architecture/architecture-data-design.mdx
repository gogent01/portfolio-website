- major files and table designs used with considered alternatives for each column and table
- rationales for choices of databases, including vs. flat file storage, and of their count (single vs. multiple)
- what reading schemes are going to be used in various parts of the program (look-ahead / just-in-time / look-behind)
- level of I/O error detection: at the field / record / stream / file level
- possible interactions with other programs on the same data or resources
- if the system is going to share data or resources with other systems, the architecture should specify how this is going to be performed

Note: usually, only *one* class should be able to access database data directly.
