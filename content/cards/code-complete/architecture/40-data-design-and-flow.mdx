- major files and table designs used + considered alternatives for each table and column
- rationales for choices of databases and their count, including vs. flat file storage
- reading schemes to be used in various parts of the program (look-ahead / just-in-time / look-behind)
- level of I/O error detection: at the field / record / stream / file level
- possible interactions with other programs on the same data or resources, and how this is to be handled

Note: usually, only *one* class should be able to access database data directly.
