- program organization
- major classes and subsystems
- data design
- business rules
- user interface design
- resource management
- security
- performance
- scalability
- interoperability (sharing of data or resources with other systems)
- internationalization
- input/output
- error processing
- fault tolerance
- architectural feasibility
- approach to overengineering
- buy vs. build decisions
- change strategy

All decisions should be expressed in a clear language, and, ideally, *explaining alternatives* considered and *reasons* for the final choice.
