- what possible enhancements have been considered (OS and package updates, IO formats, UI interactions, processing requirements)?
- for the most likely enhancements, show how these are prepared to be the easiest to implement
- for most of the enhancements considered, show the effects of any change are going to target the smallest number of classes and their subsystems
- strategies used to delay greater code change commitments (e.g., using table-driven flow control instead of `if` statements, or having external configuration files)
