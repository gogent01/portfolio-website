- the architecture should define the major building blocks of a program
- building blocks are single classes or subsystems of classes
- every feature in requirements must be covered with at least one building block
- each block should have a single area of responsibility and know as little as possible about other blocks
- communication between blocks should be well-defined, the architecture should specify which blocks are using which blocks in direct or indirect way
- if the architecture depends on specific business rules, it should specify them and describe their impact on the system's design
